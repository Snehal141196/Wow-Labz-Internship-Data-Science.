# Wow-Labz-Internship-Data-Science.
Here's the description of what I have studied in the first Unit. In the first unit there was may resources and by the end of this unit I will be familiar with Python basic and Machine Learning concepts.
1) The Data Science Process:
   What is the work of the Data Scientist? 
   i)So Data Scientist first role is to Frame the problem means about the client and the problem of the client which the Data Scientist has to solve.
   ii)Acc to the clients problem statement get the raw data needed to solve the problem and from that raw data get the important features and drop the features which are not   important.
   iii) We have to process the data means we have to do Data Wrangling that means in raw data there will many null values or error values or corrupt data. So first we have to solve that before going further to build a model.
   iv)Explore the data. Once we have cleaned data then after that we have to undersatnd the data by building Graphs beacuse with graph its easy to understand the dataset.
   v)Perform Data Analysis means make a suitable model with more accuracy.
   vi)Communicate result of analysis:- And then Sum up all the result with the model you have got with correct accuracy to get the best model.

2) What is Python:-
   i)The programming requirements of data science demands a very versatile yet flexible language which is simple to write the code but can handle highly complex mathematical processing. Python is most suited for such requirements as it has already established itself both as a language for general computing as well as scientific computing. More over it is being continuously upgraded in form of new addition to its plethora of libraries aimed at different programming requirements. Below we will discuss such features of python which makes it the preferred language for data science.
   ii)A simple and easy to learn language which achieves result in fewer lines of code than other similar languages like R. Its simplicity also makes it robust to handle complex scenarios with minimal code and much less confusion on the general flow of the program.
   iii)Most importantly Python has got a very large collection of libraries which serve as special purpose analysis tools. For example â€“ the NumPy package deals with scientific computing and its array needs much less memory than the conventional python list for managing numeric data. And the number of such packages is continuously growing.
   
3) Data Wrangling:-
   i)Data Wrangling is the process of gathering, collecting, and transforming Raw data into another format for better understanding, decision-making, accessing, and analysis in less time. Data Wrangling is also known as Data Munging.
   ii)Data wrangling in python deals with the below functionalities:
       I] Data exploration: In this process, the data is studied, analyzed and understood by visualizing representations of data.
       II]Dealing with missing values: Most of the datasets having a vast amount of data contain missing values of NaN, they are needed to be taken care of by replacing them with mean, mode, the most frequent value of the column or simply by dropping the row having a NaN value.
       III]Reshaping data: In this process, data is manipulated according to the requirements, where new data can be added or pre-existing data can be modified.
       IV]Filtering data: Some times datasets are comprised of unwanted rows or columns which are required to be removed or filtered
       V]Other: After dealing with the raw dataset with the above functionalities we get an efficient dataset as per our requirements and then it can be used for a required purpose like data analyzing, machine learning, data visualization, model training etc.
  
 4) Supervised Machine Learning:-
    Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.
    Types of Supervised machine learningg algorithms are 1) Regression and 2) Classification
    Regression :- Regression algorithms are used if there is a relationship between the input variable and the output variable. It is used for the prediction of continuous variables, such as Weather forecasting, Market Trends, etc.
    Classification :- Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical, which means there are two classes such as Yes-No, Male-Female, True-false, etc.
 
 5) Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm :-Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical, which means there are two classes such as Yes-No, Male-Female, True-false, etc.
    Types of Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are 1) Clustering and 2)Association
    i) Clustering: Clustering is a method of grouping the objects into clusters such that objects with most similarities remains into a group and has less or no similarities with the objects of another group.
    ii) Association: An association rule is an unsupervised learning method which is used for finding the relationships between variables in the large database. It determines the set of items that occurs together in the dataset.
